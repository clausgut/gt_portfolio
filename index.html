          Let's see how this drama goes. I am originally from Peru, been here in the states since 2014. This is a beautiful country full of life changing opportunities; now you know why so many people is trying to jump the wall, 
          ok that was a bad joke let me continue ... I am 23 years old and
          I currently work as an Underwriter Assistant, we do this fun activity that consists of sitting down all day long in front of a computer 
          checking policies and prices, ain't that fun?
          I have been in the insurance industry for the last 4 years, started as an Auto Insurance Sales Agent (nice title but not my thing) and 
          3 years after realized that I was as many others an unhappy employee and I was holding onto a place/position (good pay)
          that made Claudia miserable. Did you spot the problem? it took me 3 YEARS to realize it and face it, imagine how my love life went.
          I left that job last year and I have never felt so relieved. Had a long month of wonderful vacation and interviews, of course, until I 
          came accross this great company, SIU. 
          They are truly awesome, I love this family oriented culture all around the company, well it's also a family owned business I guess it 
          makes sense right ? I have one of the sweetest managers I have ever had in my life and the most important detail, they offer several 
          food events for the employees all year around and that right there is pure love, at least for me.
          At this point you may be questioning, why are you reading this?...(I am asking that too) Well I had to write a little something about 
          me for this page and this is all I am coming up with. 
          Let me also tell you that I have always been very curious about computers and did very well in high school in computer science(do not 
          ask me about the rest), also took some extra curricular classes after high school like Microsoft, Corel Draw, C++, Web developement(begginers, 
          nothing like this bootcamp) but little did I know that coding was going to be my next big step in life.
          To be fully honest with everyone reading this, prior landing to Georgia, I had done some research in Lima(capital of Peru) about universities and colleges in the 
          Atlanta area and had found not only good but amazing information and reviews about Georgia Tech, so I had this naive idea that I was going to walk
          to GT and enroll and we were all going to be happy (yes I laugh at it, now);little Claudia had forgotten about a substantial detail "THE MONEY"
          who on earth was going to pay the small fee of 40,000 a year? It was dissapointying but also challenging and I love challenges so yes, one thing
          lead to another and I am finally about to achieve one of the very first goals I had when I got to America. 
          Choosing programming obvioulsy was not an easy choice nor my first one; you have no idea how many times I changed majors when I was enrolled in GTC, to the point that I was embarrased to go to the Student Advisor one more time 
          with a new made up excuse of why this is Claudia's third consecutive change of majors in one academic year (yes, that many). I guess it all pretty much worked out, because
          I feel back in place and moreover pretty confident about my future success in this class. I am thankful to be part of this group and I know wonderful things will come out of this experience.
